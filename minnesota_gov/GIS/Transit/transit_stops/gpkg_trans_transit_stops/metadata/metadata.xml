TRANSITSTOPS
side_id:  The primary key field and unique stop identification number assigned by Metro Transit.
 
site_on:  The street or address where the stop is found.
 
site_at:  The cross street or address nearest the stop.

CornerNumber: Unique id for corner location description that is used to locate a stop at an intersection by defining the direction of travel on the street where the stop is located and the stop's relationship to the nearest cross street.
 
corn_desc:  The description of the corner the bus stop is on.

city:  The city the stop is located in. 

county: The county where the stop is located in.

publiccomm:  Miscellaneous oomments about the stop.

dt_zone:  The stop is part of the 50-cent Downtown Fare Zone.

parkride:  The bus stop is at a park &amp; ride.

adaaccess:  The stop has a firm surface.

busstop_yn: Indicates whether boarding and alighting may occur at a stop. This is used to filter out timepoints and control points used in Metro Transit Scheduling.

IsSuspended: The stop has been suspended temporarily but indefinitely from use in schedules. It will be flagged for installers to apply a “suspended” decal without removing the sign, if one is present.

node_id:  For those sites that are nodes, this field contains their four letter identification.  Nodes are often timepoints, or places where the bus has to arrive/depart at a certain time.  Note, however, that more than one site can have the same Nodeid because a route will use different sites in different directions. 

gate: The gate letter or number used for distinguishing stops at specific areas.

T_Code: Transit code TxBase facility identifier. There are cases where stops are associated with a facility. This identifier establishes the relationship between the stop and the facility. 

UNIQUE_ID: the street identification number the stop is localized on. Numbers match the road centerlines served on the MN Geospatial Commons, which has adopted the GAC standard. Please note that some IDs are custom HASTUS generated during street adjustment process.

board_flag: this flag indicates if any bus trip allows boarding at the stop. 0 = No; 1 = Yes

alight_flag: this flag indicates if any bus trip allows alighting at the stop. 0 = No; 1 = Yes

active_status: indicates whether stop is active or archived. Active is defined as an available stop for Metro Transit scheduling department. Archived defined as stop that has been eliminated indefinitely for schedules. 

itinerary_yn: indicates whether a stops is part of Service Week's active itinerary. Itinerary is defined as the route/path taken from one stop to the next stop.

route_provider: indicates the line provider that serves the stop. Metro Transit trumps other providers if there are multiple providers servicing the stop. Met Council trumps other providers besides Metro Transit if there are multiple providers servicing a stop. Therefore, if just Metro Transit and just Met Council appear as value, it does not mean the sole provider for that stop. 

TRANSITSTOPS_ROUTESSERVED_TBL
site_id: The primary key field and unique stop identification number assigned by Metro Transit.

ROUTES: The routes that use the transit stop (does not include seperation of terminal letters).

NROUTES: The number of unique routes that use the transit stop (does include seperation of terminal letters).

ROUTEDIRS: A list of routes and direction of travel seperated by a colon (does not include seperation of terminal letters). NB = Northbound; EB = Eastbound; SB = Southbound; and WB = Westbound.

ROUTETERMDIRS: A list of routes with terminal letter included and direction of travel seperated by a colon (does include seperation of terminal letters). NB = Northbound; EB = Eastbound; SB = Southbound; and WB = Westbound.

TRANSITSTOPS_TRIPCOUNT_TBL
RouteID: A number identifying the route number associated with the route and
its schedules.

ScheduleTypeAbbr: Trips are seperated by day of week in which they occur. This field indicates which day of week is represented. See notes below.

Service Abbr notes:
WK = Trips that occur during weekdays.
SAT = Trips that occur during Saturday.
SUN = Trips that occur during Sunday.
FRI = Additional trips to weekdays that occur on Friday.
HOL = Trips that occur during holidays.

ScheduleTypeName: Non-abbreviate ScheduleType.

StopID: The primary key field and unique stop identification number assigned by Metro Transit.

EAM: The number of trips in Early AM.

AMP: The number of trips in AM Peak.

MID: The number of trips in Midday.

PMP: The number of trips in PM Peak.

EVE: The number of trips in Evening.

NIGHT: The number of trips in Night.

OWL: The number of trips in very early morning (nicknamed Owl).

TripCount: The total number of trips traveled during all time periods.

Time period notes:
a. EAM - Early Morning = 4:30AM to 6:00AM = 90 minute duration
b. AMP - AM Peak = 6:00AM to 9:00AM = 180 minute duration
c. MID - Midday = 9:00AM to 3:00PM = 360 minute duration
d. PMP - PM Peak = 3:00PM to 6:30PM = 210 minute duration
e. EVE - Evening = 6:30PM to 9:00PM = 150 minute duration
f. NIGHT - Night = 9:00PM to 1:30AM = 270 minute duration
g. OWL - Owl = 1:30AM to 4:30AM = 180 minute duration
