						Title: 
					</span><span>School Attendance Area Boundaries, Minnesota, SY2025-26</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Abstract: 
					</span><span>This file represents the boundaries of all reported public school attendance areas in the state of Minnesota for school year 2025-26. Attendance areas attempt to represent the detailed sub-district breakdowns that determine where students attend elementary, middle, and high schools. These areas are unique to each public school system, and this file is only a generalization of those breakdowns.
<br>
<br>In most cases, users are interested in the "dissolved" school district boundaries, without attendance area breakdowns. Those boundaries are available in a separate resource, with one record for each independent, common, and special school district in Minnesota. For many districts that operate only a few schools, attendance area breakdowns are not used or defined; in those cases, attendance areas are equivalent to district boundaries.
<br>
<br>Each year Minnesota public school systems are asked to report any changes to their elementary, middle and high school attendance area boundaries. This file was developed from this annual information. Users should be aware that reporting compliance is not mandatory, so the information included is only as accurate as provided by those independent, common, and special school districts. Actual decisions on where students attend which schools are made entirely by the districts, and changes are not always reported to MDE.
<br>
<br>Please also see Horizontal Positional Accuracy notes in the school district boundary dataset, many of which also apply to this layer.
<br>
<br><br></span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Purpose: 
					</span><span>To keep this dataset current, the Minnesota Department of Education (MDE) asks school districts for any changes to district attendance boundaries on a yearly basis. This dataset, along with additional information from MDE databases, is used by MDE's Food and Nutrition Services Office to identify program financial priorities. It also is used in mapping products of school attendance area boundaries and school district boundaries; those products support a variety of mapping and data analysis applications.</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>

					Section 2: Data Quality
				</h2><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Attribute Accuracy: 
					</span><span>Each school district is asked to check the previous year's school district map for accuracy of school names and attendance boundaries. Reported changes are verified by MDE's GIS Coordinator. Not all school districts provide responses to the annual review.
<br>
<br>Note 1: School names listed for elementary, middle, and high school attendance areas are often abbreviated for ease of labeling in maps.
<br>Note 2: Not every school district operates the same way, and often multiple matriculation paths are available for students. These boundaries generally do not incorporate "magnet" schools or "regional" schools run by districts.
<br>Note 3: In general, MDE staff attempt to associate schools serving grades KG-4 in the "elementary" (elem) columns, grades 5-8 in the "middle" (midd) columns, and grades 9-12 in the "high" columns. However, these are generalizations, and there are many situations where the grade splits between schools do not match exactly.
<br>Note 4: The MDE team makes every effort to identify and demarcate "multiple" school situations. When the "<levl>_multi" columns designate a "multiple" situation with a "Y", the identifier shown in the "<levl>_orgid" column represents ONLY ONE of the schools named.
<br>Note 5: Typically when the "<levl>_multi" columns designate a "multiple" situation with a "Y", a "choice" situations is represented in the "<levl>_name" column with an "OR" between the named schools, and a "combination" (such as splitting grades) is represented in the "<levl>_name" column with an "&" between the named schools.</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Logical Consistency:
					</span><span>Data are topologically structured and verified.</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Completeness:
					</span><span>Attendance areas for all school districts within Minnesota are included, but only as they are discovered by staff, or otherwise reported to MDE. Please note that airports are detached from school district boundaries as per MN 473.625., so coverage of the Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport is not included.</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Horizontal Positional Accuracy:
					</span><span>Positional accuracy of the data sources varies widely. Source scales range between 1:24,000 and 1:100,000.  Many of the boundaries are hand-drawn by LEAs and provided to MDE on various media. Others are derived from PDF maps, provided shapefiles, or interactive attendance maps. See notes on potential boundary inaccuracies under 'Lineage', particularly for historical versions of this dataset.
<br>
<br>To the extent possible, MDE uses county parcel data to determine overall district boundaries, which impact the attendance areas. Please read the accuracy notes on the school district boundary dataset if using this layer.
<br>
<br>NOTES ON MISMATCHES OF DATA: because district boundaries are derived from this file, users should be aware of potential mismatches as identified in the metadata for school district boundaries.</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>

<br>
<br>Details on individual columns:
<br>sdorgid: unique ORG ID number used to link the district to the "MDE ORG" database. See Detailed Citation for a link where that database can be searched.
<br>
<br>sdtype:  In state statute, there are three types of school districts that have boundaries. This type identifier, used at MDE, describes the types as follows:
<br>   03 - "Special" School Districts: includes only Minneapolis (SD #0001) and South St. Paul (SD #0006)
<br>   02 - Common School Districts: includes only Franconia (SD #0323) and Prinsburg (SD #0815)
<br>   01 - Independent School Districts
<br>(Note also that Minneapolis and Aitkin school districts both have a school district identifier (sdnumber) of "1" or "0001", making this identifier important for uniqueness.)
<br>
<br>sdnumber: School district number (i.e. 2908 for Brandon-Evansville, 0001 for Aitkin and Minneapolis, 0011 for Anoka-Hennepin, etc)
<br>
<br>sdprefname: School district name, derived from the organization's "preferred name" within the MDE ORG database. (Prior publications used a more simplified name.)
<br>
<br>elem_orgid: the 11-digit ORG ID number used to uniquely identify the elementary school named in the "elem_name" column.
<br>
<br>elem_name: Elementary school name of the primary elementary school within the attendance area. Multiple names may be listed for various reasons described below.
<br>
<br>elem_multi: A designator intended to convey when students within an area can choose to attend multiple elementary schools or other various scenarios, such as PK-KG centers or elementary buildings that split grades.
<br>
<br>midd_orgid: the 11-digit ORG ID number used to uniquely identify the middle school named in the "midd_name" column
<br>
<br>midd_name: Middle school name of the primary middle school within the attendance area. In many cases, this is blank because some districts only have elementary and secondary schools.
<br>
<br>midd_multi: A designator intended to convey when students within an area can choose to attend multiple middle schools, or other various scenarios, such as separate middle school and junior high buildings.
<br>
<br>high_orgid: the 11-digit ORG ID number used to uniquely identify the high school named in the "high_name" column
<br>
<br>high_name: High school name of the primary high school within the attendance area.
<br>
<br>high_multi: A designator intended to convey when students within an area can choose to attend multiple high schools or other various scenarios, such as split secondary buildings.
