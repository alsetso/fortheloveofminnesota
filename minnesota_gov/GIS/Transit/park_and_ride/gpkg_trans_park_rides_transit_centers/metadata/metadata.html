						Title: 
					</span><span>Park & Rides and Transit Centers</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Abstract: 
					</span><span>The Park & Rides and Transit Centers layer contains a comprehensive inventory of park and ride and transit center facilities throughout the Twin Cities Metropolitan area and surrounding counties. Park & Rides are defined as facilities with transit service and parking available, for transit customer and carpool use. Transit Centers are defined as facilities where: two or more routes connect to transfer passengers, buses connect off street (or in clearly designated on-street spaces), there are marked 'gates' for different routes and directions, the location serves a major activity center, and there is a standing facility, or in some cases, a collection of bus shelters. 
<br>
<br>The dataset was geocoded using TLG centerline streets. When specific site details were available, the geography was moved off street lines to actual facility locations using orthophotographic imagery as a base layer. All attempts were made to correctly reflect the real lot locations; however the positional accuracy of this data cannot be guaranteed. 
<br>
<br>The Park-and-Ride Annual Survey lookup table contains information about the capacity and usage at each park-and-ride facility. This table does not include data regarding transit center facilities. Capacity and usage at Park and Pool lots, which are found in a seperate geographic dataset, are also recorded in the Park-and-Ride Annual Survey Table. 
<br>
<br>Attribute information is considered current to the metadata date and will be updated as needed. <br></span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
