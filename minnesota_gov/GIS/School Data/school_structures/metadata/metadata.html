					Section 1: Overview
				</h2><div class="mgmgel"><span>Originator:</span><span>Minnesota Department of Education</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Title: 
					</span><span>Public School Buildings in Minnesota</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Abstract: 
					</span><span>This data set represents footprints of buildings that primarily serve as sites for delivering non-charter, K-12 public education in Minnesota. The goal is to discretely and uniquely identify specific buildings, designated by specific street addresses, that house one or more active public school programs. More specifically, school programs classified as elementary, middle, junior high, senior high, or secondary, delivered by independent or special school districts.
<br>
<br>In contrast to MDE's annually updated school program locations data set that uniquely identifies specific programs, when a single building houses multiple programs, this data set will have just one record. For example, a single building might house a district office, an ECFE program, an elementary program, and a middle school program. In this case, the name assigned will be for the "highest classification" - in other words, the middle school program. This is often an oversimplified name for the building, but it is more complete than relying on incomplete building names from OpenStreetMap (OSM).
<br>
<br>This data set is designed for geospatial software users who require basic details (building name and address) on locations of buildings that are primarily used for public education, but also are frequently used for other community needs. It covers most, but not all, active public school program locations (see Completeness section). It does not include charter schools, private schools, or buildings delivering educational programs outside of grades K-12, such as early childhood centers delivering only pre-K programs. (Early childhood centers including at least a KG grade are included.)<br></span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Purpose: 
					</span><span>The intended purpose of this dataset is to identify "major" buildings where public K-12 school programs are actively being delivered. These buildings frequently have unique qualities and play a unique role within local communities, and this data set can serve as a "simpler" view of public education facilities than MDE's school program locations dataset. It should NOT be used to identify every place where educational programs are taking place, because there are several exceptions to the buildings included (see the Abstract and Completeness sections). If you need to identify any place educational programs are delivered, use the struc-school-program-locs dataset.</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>

					Section 2: Data Quality
				</h2><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Attribute Accuracy: 
					</span><span>Spot checks have been performed on this dataset, but no guarantee of accuracy is provided. While MNIT staff track OSM edits to school buildings daily, and learn about new construction via MDE-ORG, they have few mechanisms to track reconstruction projects that may significantly alter existing K12 building footprints.</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Logical Consistency:
					</span><span>Not applicable</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Completeness:
					</span><span>This dataset consists of almost 1200 buildings, covering all active public, non-charter, K-12 programs in MDE's organization database other than the exceptions listed below. Please note that building footprints sourced from OpenStreetMap (OSM) may be outdated; for example, if a building expands or contracts, but the older footprint still contains the K12 school point, the new footprint might not be reflected in this dataset.
<br>
<br>Please also note that two types of buildings tagged as school buildings in OSM are withheld from this dataset:
<br>1) Buildings that no longer house active K-12 school programs, such as Central Elementary in Bemidji. There are many former school buildings that are still standing, but as of the publication date were not housing active public school programs.
<br>2) Buildings that do not intersect the "main" site for delivering school programs. These can be "outbuildings" or merely separate polygons created in OSM for specific details. (Often a single building is broken up into separate polygons.) They can also exist in specific situations where districts have multiple buildings on a site but have consolidated programs into one record with a single address.
<br>
<br>Additional exceptions to active public school K-12 programs that are not included in this dataset are identified by state organization ID and brief descriptions below:
<br>--Buildings that are more than just "schools", so didn't make sense to tag as a school building in Open Street Map:
<br>10707001000 -- Nett Lake Elementary
<br>30001363000 --Wellstone International High in Minneapolis
<br>--Religious Colony schools:
<br>12888006000, 12888007000 -- Lismore Colony Schools
<br>12689006000 -- Heartland Colony
<br>10150011000 -- Spring Prairie Colony
<br>12888004000,12888010000 -- Big Stone Colony schools
<br>--Other situations:
<br>10882062000 --Monticello Nature-based Education
<br>
<br>In fall 2025, some early childhood centers that did not house kindergarten programs were removed.</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Horizontal Positional Accuracy:
					</span><span>Unknown</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
								Vertical Positional Accuracy:
							</span><span>NA</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Lineage:
					</span><span>Building footprints are sourced from OpenStreetMap (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.openstreetmap.org)">https://www.openstreetmap.org)</a>, downloaded via the "Quick OSM" QGIS plugin, which leverages the Overpass API. The simple query performed is for buildings tagged as "school" or "kindergarten" within the boundary of Minnesota.
<br>
<br>More information on the quick OSM plugin is available at <a target="_blank" href="https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/QuickOSM/&#xD;">https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/QuickOSM/
</a><br>
<br>Footprints are then merged with MDE organizational information on active public schools for building name and address information. When more than one program is housed in a building, the "highest classification" in terms of grade levels is used for the building name. For example, if a building houses both a middle school and a high school, the name of the high school is used for the building. When more than one building is present at a specific site, but only one street address is used, only the building intersecting the main school locations is used.</span></div><br><h2 class="unused"><a name="Spatial_Data_Organization_Information"></a>
